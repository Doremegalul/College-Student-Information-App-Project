# College Student Information App Project Description
This repository consists of a collection of C++ files designed for a project that manages college data:

- array.h: A header file defining array structures or templates, used for managing collections of data objects in the project.

- student.h: This header file declares the structure or class for student-related data, encompassing student attributes and functions.

- student.cpp: The implementation file for student.h, containing the definitions of the student class's methods and functions.

- college.dat: A data file, which includes student or college-related data in a structured format, processed and analyzed by the project.

- college_phase2_test_case.txt: This file contains test cases or data for validating and testing the project's functionality in a second phase of development.

- college.cpp: The main C++ file, integrating various aspects of the project, handling college-related data, and implementing logic for operations on student data.

This repository serves as a comprehensive tool for managing and processing college-related data, showcasing practical applications of object-oriented programming, data handling, and file manipulation in C++.
