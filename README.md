# College Student Information App Project Description
This repository contains a suite of C++ files for a project focused on managing college data:

- array.h: A header file likely defining array structures or templates, possibly used for managing collections of data objects in the project.

- student.h: This header file presumably declares the structure or class for student-related data, such as student attributes and functions.

- student.cpp: The corresponding implementation file for student.h, containing the definitions of the student class's methods and functions.

- college.dat: A data file, which may include student or college-related data in a structured format, to be processed and analyzed by the project.

- college_phase2_test_case.txt: This file likely contains test cases or data used for validating and testing the project's functionality in a second phase of development.

- college.cpp: The main C++ file, probably integrating various aspects of the project, such as handling college-related data and implementing the logic for operations on student data.

This repository appears to be a comprehensive toolkit for managing and processing college-related data, demonstrating practical applications of object-oriented programming, data handling, and file manipulation in C++.
